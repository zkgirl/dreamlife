Will you wake... or become it?\"\r Document Type\tProduct Requirements Document (PRD)\r Hackathon\tDreamWare Hackathon 2025 — Engineering the Surreal\r Timeline\tNovember 28 – December 1, 2025 (72 hours)\r Version\t1.0\r 1. Executive Summary\r DreamLife is a surreal life simulator where players enter the subconscious of a mysterious Dream Guide. Unlike traditional life simulators, you don't play as your character — you shape their dream, mutating emotions, memories, and reality through poetic choices. The experience uses BitLife-style progression where age represents depth, but everything operates on dream logic: events are symbolic, the world is sentient and reacts to choices, and a central mystery drives the narrative — \"Whose dream is this? Why are you trapped here?\"\r Each run lasts 15-20 minutes, designed for replayability to uncover different truths. Players increase their lucidity, collect symbols, and unlock multiple emotionally-driven endings. The project targets all five Dream Fragments (Fluid Interface, Emotional Memory, Temporal Shifts, Metamorphic Media, Voice of the Machine) to create an experience that feels alive, emotional, and unpredictable.\r 2. Problem Statement & Vision\r 2.1 The Problem\r Traditional life simulators feel mechanical — menus, stats, and choices that lack emotional weight. They're apps that \"work\" but don't breathe. Players make decisions without feeling their consequences ripple through a living world.\r 2.2 Our Vision\r Create a piece of software that feels like a dream — surreal, alive, and strangely real. DreamLife whispers, mutates, and remembers feelings. The interface itself is part of the experience: no menus, everything contextual drift, stats that pulse with mood, and a world that visibly cracks when you hurt it.\r 2.3 Why This Wins\r •\tFluid Flow: No menus, everything contextual drift — the interface disappears into the dream\r •\tEmotional Gravity: Mystery narrative plus visible memory cracks create genuine stakes\r •\tSignature Moment: Time-loop mechanic delivers unexpected \"holy shit\" experiences\r •\tInsane Polish: Breathing UI, morphing backgrounds, and ambient audio that responds to emotion\r 3. Dream Fragments Implementation\r DreamLife implements all five Dream Fragments as core systems, not add-ons:\r Fragment\tImplementation\tUser Experience\r Fluid Interface\tNo tabs/menus — events and choices float in contextually using Framer Motion animations\tChoices drift like whispers; stats glow as pulsing orbs; ripples on hover\r Emotional Memory\tMemory stat (0-100) directly impacts visuals: low = UI cracks, high = bloom particles\tWhispers say \"You forgot me...\"; events turn dark or warm based on memory\r Temporal Shifts\tTime-loop mechanic: every 5-10 years, past events rewind with new choices\t\"You relive the mirror shatter... but this time, the child speaks.\"\r Metamorphic Media\tp5.js backgrounds morph live; CSS distortion shaders on low memory; react-particles form symbols\tFog forests bloom into voids; particles spell words like \"Forgiven\"\r Voice of Machine\tDream Guide whispers poetic commentary; ambient audio shifts with mood (Howler.js)\t\"You chose kindness... but whose face do you see in the mirror?\"\r 4. Core Gameplay Loop\r The gameplay loop is simple but immersive, with no \"app feel\" — everything floats and drifts:\r 1.\tDrift into Next Depth: Screen softly fades, background morphs (fog thickens). A random surreal event emerges from the haze as a center card with poetic text.\r 2.\tContextual Choices Appear: 2-3 options drift in like whispers near the event. Example: \"A fractured mirror reflects your unborn child.\" Choices: \"Embrace the echo\" / \"Shatter it\" / \"Buy a veil of forgetfulness\"\r 3.\tWorld Reacts Instantly: Stats glow and update; background cracks or whispers if memory is low; symbols collect. Time-loop may trigger, rewinding past events with a twist.\r 4.\tNew Drift: Contextual memories fade in (job as glowing silhouette, relationship as echoing voice). Repeat until ending at age 80+ or collapse.\r Run Length: 15-20 years (depth levels), auto-advance with pauses for immersion. Choices are emotional, not mechanical.\r 5. Dream Stats System\r Minimal, always-visible glowing orbs float at the top, pulsing with mood:\r •\tEnergy (Health): 0-100, low = screen shakes, eventual collapse\r •\tLucidity (Intelligence): High = predictable drifts, low = chaos morphs and unpredictable events\r •\tAura (Appearance): Affects relationships — dim glow makes echoes fade away\r •\tEmotional Memory: 0-100, the CORE stat. High = soft blooms/whispers, low = UI cracks, dark events\r •\tShards (Wealth): Currency for dream relics and memory veils\r •\tSymbols: 5-10 collectibles (\"Fractured Key\") forming a visible memory garden\r 6. Key Features (MVP Scope)\r Focus on depth over breadth — three polished systems, all JSON-driven:\r 6.1 Surreal Jobs (Career Drift)\r Glowing silhouettes offer roles like \"Echo Weaver\" (therapist) or \"Nightmare Senator.\" 10-15 jobs total, advancing via choices that affect Lucidity. Jobs \"remember\" — kind work creates loyal echoes, greedy work causes time-loop betrayals.\r 6.2 Echo Relationships (Emotional Bonds)\r Voices and figures drift in (\"Mirror Lover\" proposes). Build family with echo children to name and raise via mini-drifts. Divorce causes memory cracks. 5-8 NPCs maximum, reacting to mood — high memory brings support whispers, low memory brings hauntings.\r 6.3 Morphing Assets (Reality Shifts)\r Spend shards on dream relics: \"Star Chariot\" (car) for faster drifts and +Aura, \"Cloud Manor\" (house) for memory boost. Assets change the world — wealth creates blooming islands, poverty opens void cracks. 5-7 assets maximum.\r 6.4 Time Loop (Signature Mechanic)\r Every 5-10 years, a random past event rewinds: \"You relive the mirror shatter... but this time, the child speaks.\" Choices branch to alternate truths, unlocking mystery clues. Loop frequency increases when memory is low — the dream becomes more unstable.\r 7. Central Mystery: \"Whose Dream Is This?\"\r A soft narrative thread woven through gameplay — no heavy text, just subtle immersion:\r 7.1 The Dream Guide\r A whispering entity appears as a faint silhouette, commenting poetically on choices: \"You chose kindness... but whose face do you see in the mirror?\" The Guide evolves visually based on player decisions.\r 7.2 Mystery Arc\r Collect 3-5 \"Forgotten Fragments\" (symbols) revealing the truth: this dream belongs to a lost soul — perhaps an abandoned child or forgotten lover. Clues appear in loops and events: \"Why do the echoes call you 'thief'?\" Endings resolve the mystery emotionally.\r 7.3 Emotional Gravity\r Choices tie to the theme — avoid regrets and the mystery haunts you. Embrace them and find catharsis. The goal: \"feels like therapy in code.\"\r 8. Endings (5 Poetic Conclusions)\r Triggered at age 80+ or by specific conditions. Each ending features a full-screen morph, 30-second cinematic with audio swell, and 2-3 line epilogue:\r 1.\tLucid Awakening (High Lucidity): \"You shatter the veil. The Guide smiles: 'You were me all along.' Fragments reform — you wake changed.\"\r 2.\tEternal Embrace (High Memory): \"The echoes pull you in. 'Stay,' they whisper. Your garden blooms forever.\"\r 3.\tFractured Void (Low Energy): \"Cracks swallow all. The Guide fades: 'Forgotten, like us.' Silence.\"\r 4.\tLoop Eternal (Many Time-Loops): \"Time folds. You relive... forever. Whose dream now?\"\r 5.\tMemory Thief (High Shards, Low Memory): \"You steal the last fragment. Rich in shards, empty in echoes. The Guide weeps.\"\r 9. Technical Architecture\r 9.1 Tech Stack\r •\tFramework: Next.js (using hackathon starter)\r •\tStyling: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (fluid animations)\r •\tState Management: Zustand (simple, reactive)\r •\tVisual Effects: p5.js (morphing backgrounds), react-particles (symbol particles)\r •\tAudio: Howler.js (ambient sounds, mood shifts)\r •\tData: JSON files for events, jobs, assets, relationships\r 9.2 Data Architecture\r All game content is JSON-driven for rapid iteration: 20 surreal events, 10-15 jobs, 5-7 assets, 5-8 relationship starters. Each JSON entry includes poetic text, choice arrays, stat impacts, and visual/audio triggers.\r 10. 72-Hour Development Roadmap\r Hours\tFocus & Deliverables\r 0-12\tSetup starter, JSON events/jobs/assets structure, basic drift loop (event → choices → react)\r 12-24\tFluid UI implementation (float-ins, no menus), Emotional Memory visuals (cracks/whispers effect)\r 24-36\tSystems integration (jobs/relationships/assets contextual), Time-loop mechanic implementation\r 36-48\tMystery thread (Dream Guide whispers, fragment collection), Audio integration + particles\r 48-60\tEndings cinematics, Background morphs with p5.js basics\r 60-72\tPolish (transitions, responsive design), Bug fixes, Demo video (2-min run + mystery tease)\r 11. Success Metrics\r 11.1 Judging Criteria Alignment\r •\tTechnical Execution (40%): Stable gameplay loop, responsive UI, smooth animations, no crashes\r •\tConcept & Depth (30%): Emotional impact through memory system, cohesive dream-logic, meaningful choices\r •\tOriginality & Presence (30%): Unique atmosphere, artistry in visuals/audio, compelling mystery narrative\r 11.2 MVP Acceptance Criteria\r •\tComplete 15-20 year run without crashes\r •\tAt least 3 endings achievable\r •\tAll 5 Dream Fragments demonstrably implemented\r •\tMystery thread with at least 1 fragment collectible\r •\tTime-loop triggers at least once per run\r 12. Risks & Mitigations\r Risk\tImpact\tMitigation\r Scope creep\tUnfinished features, bugs\tStrict feature freeze at hour 48; cut to 3 endings if needed\r Visual complexity\tPerformance issues, dev time\tCSS filters before p5.js shaders; simple particle counts\r Audio integration\tBrowser autoplay blocks\tUser interaction gate; ambient loops only, no complex triggers\r Content volume\tRepetitive gameplay\t20 core events minimum; procedural variation in text\r 13. Submission Checklist\r •\tDeploy to Vercel with working demo link\r •\tGitHub repository with clean README\r •\tDiscord submission form completed\r •\t2-minute demo video: full run + mystery tease + \"crack\" moment\r •\tDescription: \"DreamLife: Fluid BitLife in a haunted subconscious.
